      <p>
        The main focus now is to build out the lore of the video game universe
        called <i>Astral Realms</i>. Here is a summary of a lot of discussion
        I&apos;ve had with ChatGPT to develop my thoughts on the core aspects of
        the game. It is included below. Also found here is a table of contents
        to explore more aspects of the game.

      <h2>Echoes of the Astral Tide</h2>
      <h3>Setting & Universe:</h3>
      <p>
        Set in an expansive astral universe influenced by a cosmic energy called
        the &quot;Astral Tide,&quot; the game features diverse territories and
        cultures impacted by a significant event known as &quot;The Great Astral
        Shift.&quot; This shift, which altered the flow of the Astral Tide,
        introduced alien species and various astral anomalies.
      </p>
      <h3>Characters:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Qyano</strong>: A Tidebinder with a deep belief in
          &quot;Astral Harmony.&quot; This space-age Don Quixote is profoundly
          passionate about this concept, which shapes the universe around him.
          Although players can customize parts of his story, his core commitment
          to the Astral Harmony remains unyielding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pancho</strong>: Loyal to Qyano, this character acts as the
          pragmatic Sancho Panza of the universe. He brings a grounding,
          practical perspective, contrasting and balancing Qyano&apos;s
          philosophical tendencies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Gameplay Dynamics:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Combat</strong>: Turn-based, emphasizing strategy, with
          Tidebinder abilities and environmental interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Narrative Choices</strong>: Players navigate intricate
          dialogues, influencing relationships, narrative progression, and
          understanding of the Astral Harmony.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Influence System</strong>: Decisions impact affiliations with
          factions and allies, leading to varied outcomes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Themes:</h3>
      <p>
        The game delves into themes of cosmic unity (Astral Harmony), the
        complexities of friendship and loyalty (primarily between Qyano and
        Pancho), the moral ambiguities of decisions, and the balance between
        profound introspection and comedy. Additionally, players navigate a
        galaxy rich in geopolitical intricacies, interacting with various
        states, factions, and unique alien races.
      </p>
      <h3>Tonal Essence:</h3>
      <p>
        &quot;Echoes of the Astral Tide&quot; can be likened to a fusion of
        &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and &quot;Star Wars.&quot; While it delves into
        profound philosophical territories reminiscent of titles like KOTOR 2,
        it also offers light-hearted, playful episodes, ensuring an engaging
        experience throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Overall, &quot;Echoes of the Astral Tide&quot; promises an immersive
          RPG journey, skillfully blending classic literature influences with
          cosmic exploration, intricate characters, and profound thematic depth.
