      <h2>Astralys Overview</h2>
      <p>
        A sprawling universe where the mysterious Astral Tide dictates the ebb
        and flow of fate, emotions, and the very fabric of reality.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Astral Tide:</strong> A pervasive energy influencing emotions,
          destinies, and technology. Reminiscent of the Force in Star Wars but
          with unique characteristics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tidebinders:</strong> Sensitive individuals who can harness
          the Tide&apos;s powers for supernatural feats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Forerunners:</strong> The ancient species that once harnessed
          both technology and the Tide in harmony. Post a cosmic event, their
          population dwindled to near-extinction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Galactic History</h3>
      <p>
        Originally, the Astral Tide flowed homogenously, softly influencing
        reality. The Forerunners thrived in this age. However, The Great Astral
        Shift disrupted this balance, introducing varied species and making the
        Tide erratic. This Shift led to areas of strong Tide presence, voids,
        and fluctuating zones, complicating the harmony between tech and Tide.
      </p>

      <h3>Species & Cultures</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Dendrans:</strong> Tree-like entities that view the Tide as
          the Astral Tree, emphasizing growth and stability. They bring wisdom
          and are vulnerable to environmental shifts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Symphonae:</strong> Celestial beings that resonate with the
          Tide as Astral Harmony. They champion unity and use their intrinsic
          connection to emotions for diplomacy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aquarids:</strong> Aquatic adventurers that see the Tide as
          the Astral Ocean, symbolizing exploration. Vital for trade and
          navigation across Astralys.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pyronians:</strong> Fiery inhabitants that interpret the Tide
          as the Astral Forge, representing both creation and destruction. They
          seek growth through challenges and conflicts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Moivari:</strong> Enigmatic guardians of the Astral Loom,
          their society revolves around prophecies and the Covens. Providers of
          cosmic insight, they weave destinies throughout Astralys.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Choreans:</strong> Graceful dancers connected with the Astral
          Dance. They view life as a universe-wide ballet and serve as jesters,
          entertainers, and cultural ambassadors, subtly influencing emotions
          and events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Forerunners:</strong> The ancient predecessors whose legacy
          remains impactful across all species. From guiding the Dendrans with
          historical wisdom, to providing ancient musical guidance to the
          Symphonae, their influence is deeply rooted in the history and culture
          of every species.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Humans:</strong> Versatile and adaptive, humans are newcomers
          to Astralys. With an innate curiosity and drive for discovery, they
          approach the Tide with a blend of skepticism and wonder. Often seen as
          the bridge between species due to their ability to understand and
          integrate diverse perspectives, humans play a crucial role in
          diplomacy and inter-species relations. Their resilience and spirit of
          innovation allow them to leave indelible marks on the cultural,
          technological, and political landscapes of the galaxy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technology & Artifacts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Technotide Artifacts:</strong> Devices from the Forerunner era
          that merge tech with the Tide. Examples include Tide Beacons, Astral
          Lenses, and Tide Stabilizers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interactions with the Tide</h3>
      <p>
        While the Tide influences all, reactions vary. Tidebinders might accept,
        navigate, or rebel against its pull. Non-sensitive individuals might
        seek Tide-rich areas for adventure or research or prefer voids for
        stable tech use.
      </p>

      <h3>Political & Economic Landscape</h3>
      <p>
        The Tide&apos;s influence has carved out trade routes, shaped political
        power bases, spawned religious sects, and defined military might. Its
        omnipresence has inevitable consequences on the sociopolitical and
        economic fabric of the galaxy.

      <h2>Astral Tide Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Concept:</strong> At the heart of Astralys lies the Astral Tide,
        a cosmic energy that permeates every corner of the galaxy. Reminiscent
        of mythological forces in other tales, the Tide is both a tool and a
        challenge, a gift and a mystery, a source of power and a test of will.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Origin:</strong> Stemming from ancient times, the Tide was
          once harmoniously wielded by the enigmatic Forerunners, blending
          seamlessly with their technology and influencing the very fabric of
          reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Great Astral Shift:</strong> A cataclysmic event that
          scattered various species across the galaxy and made the Tide&apos;s
          behavior erratic, creating zones of high energy, voids, and
          unpredictable fluctuations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tide and Technology:</strong> In the post-Shift world, the
          harmonious relationship between the Tide and technology became a
          challenge. Only skilled Tidebinders, often drawing wisdom from
          Forerunner artifacts, can navigate this delicate balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perception and Interpretation:</strong> Each species
          interprets the Tide differently, shaping their cultures, beliefs, and
          daily lives. From the Astral Tree of the Dendrans to the Astral Dance
          of the Choreans, the Tide is seen, felt, and experienced uniquely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manipulation:</strong> Tidebinders, individuals sensitive to
          the Tide, can harness its power for a plethora of supernatural feats,
          such as telekinesis, astral sight, and emotional influence. Their
          relationship with the Tide can be accepting, navigating, or
          rebellious.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Artifacts:</strong> Scattered across Astralys are technotide
          relics from the Forerunner era. These artifacts, from Tide Beacons to
          Astral Lenses, hold the key to understanding, navigating, and perhaps
          controlling the Tide&apos;s immense power.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Influence:</strong> The Astral Tide doesn&apos;t just empower;
          it shapes politics, economies, beliefs, and legends. Its ever-present
          nature dictates trade routes, power centers, religious sects, military
          tactics, and countless other facets of galactic life.
        </li>
      </ul>
