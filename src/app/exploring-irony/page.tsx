          Irony is a fascinating phenomenon. It is deeply intuitive and is
          widely recognized to serve foundational roles in humor, rhetoric, and
          various art forms such as drama and literature. And through its
          relation to humor, one recognizes that it is a universal quality in
          humans, and to the extent that it can be{" "}

            found in animals
          </Wiki.A>
          , it may well serve an evolutionary purpose as well. As opposed to
          simply viewing irony as a spurious cultural artifact, this
          investigation invites us to consider it as a foundational aspect of
          human experience. To this end, we shall explore the following topics.

          We must start somewhere, and this is as good a place as any to set us
          off on our journey. We begin by exploring why, in formal logic, the{" "}
          <i>If...Then...</i> expression (also called <i>IMPLIES</i>) does not
          match our intuitive understanding of the <i>If...Then...</i> statement
          found in natural language. Using truth tables we formulate an ironic
          variant of an <i>If...Then...</i> expression and come to see it as the
          inverse of the formal <i>If...Then...</i> statement. We speculate that
          formal logic is the minimization, or subversion, of irony, as opposed
          to an abstracted, or codified, formulation of the logic inherent in
          natural language constructs.

          Here, we develop the idea of &quot;Boolean Irony&quot; further. We
          look at the logical natural language operations, such as <i>NOT</i>,{" "}
          <i>AND</i>, and <i>OR</i>, and devise ironic variants of them. We
          relate each of them to their Boolean Logic counterparts, and propose a
          new and distinct set of Boolean expressions which aims to formalize an
          &quot;Ironic Truth&quot; as a set of twins of the &quot;Logical
          Truth&quot; of well-known Boolean operations. We discuss the
          limitations of Ironic Truth, and why some Boolean expressions may not
          be considered capable of irony. We conjecture that the logical
          constructs found in natural langauge are so formulated precisely for
          their capacity to engage in irony, as opposed to formal logic.

          Here we discuss the implications of Ironic Truth. Why do seemingly
          illogical statements resonate with us? Why does phrasing statements in
          certain ways seems to feel more rhetorical than other methods of
          phrasing? Why do certain well-known phrases feel so profound, so true?
          We investigate the linguistic structure of these phrases with regards
          to Boolean Irony, and we posit the existence of a standard ironic
          format, such that a sort of &quot;Formal Irony&quot; can be
          investigated in its own right, so that its intuitive nature can be
          more naturally explored.

          We discuss how formal logic derives its power from its functional
          properties, and how mathematics is the natural language through which
          formal logic thrives. We discuss the properties of mathematical
          operators, and elucidate how many memes share many of their same
          properties, but with regards to ironic expressions. We speculate that
          standard meme formats serve the same function in irony as standard
          operators serve in mathematics. As such, they provide a rich and
          standardized language through which to evaluate the Ironic Truth of
          Ironic Expressions, which may in no small part help explain their
          enduring popularity. Thus, we posit that memes are to irony what
          mathematics is to logic. Each is a standardized language by which
          truth, whether it be ironic or logical, is evaluated.

          We discuss the dynamics of memes - namely, their self-referential
          ability to define the context in which subsequent generations of memes
          refer to. We discuss how ironic expressions necessitate a common
          understanding of a context, by which it aims to subvert expectations.
          This capacity to directly refer to, and by extension define, the
          context of discussion, is contrasted with logic&apos;s role in
          mathematics. Logic cannot define context - only axioms do. Logic flows
          from predefined assumptions, or axioms, but cannot come to redefine
          its own context like irony can. As such, we come to an understanding
          of irony as a sort of intuitive &quot;Method of Paradoxical
          Inquiry&quot;.

          We discuss the Method of Paradoxical Inquiry with regards to
          Mathematics, Physics, and Religion. What right do we have to assume
          various axioms? What force is guiding us to declare certain
          combinations of axioms more intriguing or relevant than others?
          Through the method of paradoxical inquiry, we explore these questions,
          aiming to illustrate how ironic truth serves a foundational role in
          defining the context of pursuits. We also aim to elaborate on its
          relation to logic, which itself serves as a &quot;Method of
          Interplay&quot; whose purpose is to explore the properties of ironic
          propositions, or paradoxes.

          Here we discuss how a further understanding of Ironic Truth can help
          shape and transform various pursuits, bringing down to Earth what has
          largely been a rather ethereal discussion. If, as we&apos;ve posited,
          irony serves an important role in defining context, various industries
          would stand to gain from this insight. Through training her sense of
          irony, a student may learn better how a particular subject relates to
          the world and her life in general. Through irony, artificial
          intelligence may better understand the context and nuance of its
          prompts, allowing it to better navigate latent inconsistencies. A
          policy-maker may be able, through a cultivated sense of irony, detect
          the potential hypocrisies between the principles which he proclaims
          and the laws which he is expected to enact. Ironic Truth is a
          discussion of context as opposed to minutiae, and everywhere it is
          exercised properly, subtlety and nuance is expected to thrive,
          potentially acting as an enriching force in the world.

          Here we discuss why people interact with memes in the manner they do,
          like why it can be engaging to people without them laughing or even so
          much as smiling. This would not be the case if it were merely a form
          of comedy. We discuss why dreams may be a pure expression of Ironic
          Truth, in how they operate in an oddly meaningful yet surreal
          juxtaposition of dissimilar elements. And finally, we discuss the
          limbic system, the emotional counterpart of the prefrontal cortex. If
          irony serves as a method of establishing context, then perhaps the
          limbic system serves as the ironic processor of the brain. This would
          imply that it serves a foundational role in integrating the new
          information gained during consciousness through deeply emotional and
          intuitive ironic processes. This would upend the conventional
          bifurcation of emotion and rationality, instead suggesting that they
          are merely two sides of the same coin of our brain&apos;s ability to
          seek truth in a complex reality.

          Here we let our discussion wander into audacious territory. We tend to
          think of Truth as a Platonic Ideal. It exists outside of us, and our
          capacity for rational logic allows us to explore and discover its
          mysteries. Can the same be said of intuitive irony? The universe is
          ordered on a logical foundation, physicists say. Why can it not,
          simultaneously, also be ordered on an ironic foundation? Quantum
          mechanics needs to account for context in its equations. Perhaps a
          form of ironic truth is better suited to express these intricacies?
          Logic can be approximated through electronic logic gates, which form
          the foundation of digital processors. Can we develop ironic processors
          that compute intuition as opposed to logic? These sorts of musings are
          catalogued here, not to serve as logical conclusions, but to let us
          perceive the paradoxes inherent in declaring irony as something so
          foundational. This perhaps can act as an engine of inspiration,
          helping to direct future efforts in exploring irony.
