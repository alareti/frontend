      <h1>Astral Tide</h1>
      <h2>Astral Tide Summary - Part 1: Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>Astral Tide</b>, colloquially known as <b>tide</b>, is an
        all-encompassing energy within a galaxy reminiscent of the setting of
        Star Wars. Originating from ideas found in various works like Arcanum,
        Star Wars, The Witcher, and Halo, the tide functions much like the Force
        in Star Wars. Sensitive users, called <b>tidebinders</b>, can harness
        its powers for supernatural feats, such as telekinesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the galaxy&apos;s ancient times, only the <b>forerunners</b>, a
        singular sentient species, inhabited the stars. The tide was then spread
        homogenously, softly and symbiotically influencing reality. These
        forerunners utilized a mix of the tide and conventional technology,
        creating <b>forerunner artifacts</b> that allowed them to flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, stability was disrupted by the <b>Great Astral Shift</b> which
        introduced various <b>alien species</b> including <b>humans</b> to the
        galaxy. This event caused the tide to become erratic and heterogeneous,
        forming areas like <b>high tide zones</b> (pockets of strong tide
        influence), <b>low tide zones</b> (areas with weak tide influence),{" "}
        <b>tide voids</b> (areas devoid of it), thus ripping out the foundations
        upon which forerunner society was built upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the wake of the Shift&apos;s aftermath,{" "}
        <b>tide and technology are now often in conflict</b>. Places with strong
        tide presence cause technology to behave unpredictably. Only skilled
        tidebinders, through studying ancient forerunner artifacts, can emulate
        the seamless integration once common, now known as{" "}
        <b>technotide items</b>. As for the forerunners, post-Shift struggles
        led them to near-extinction, leaving only a few hidden throughout the
        galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tide is seen not merely as an <b>energy</b> but also as a{" "}
        <b>will</b>, directing those aligned with its flow towards their
        destiny. However, those adept can navigate and even influence its
        currents, changing their fate. Resisting the tide&apos;s direction,
        though, comes at considerable physical, mental, and spiritual costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different <b>cultures</b> perceive the tide through their lenses,
        ranging from viewing it as a deity, a life force, a test, a blessing, or
        even as pure chaos.
      </p>
      <h2>Astral Tide Summary - Part 2: Individual and Cultural Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        The tide deeply influences both the mental and physical spheres of
        existence. Emotions both affect the tide and are shaped by it. Powerful
        tidebinders can wield incredible abilities in areas with strong tide
        presence or even transport its power through Technotide Artifacts like
        Astral Batteries
      </p>
      <p>
        Technotide Artifacts are remnants of the Forerunner era. Some examples
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tide Beacons: Devices to help navigate areas dense with the tide.
        </li>
        <li>
          Astral Lenses: Enhance a tidebinder&apos;s vision, revealing hidden
          patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tide Stabilizers: Create pockets of stability in fluctuating areas.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For tide-insensitive individuals, the relationship varies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Commoners might prefer tide voids, relying on conventional tech.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adventurers could brave tide-dense zones seeking fortune or danger.
        </li>
        <li>
          Astral researchers, though insensitive, could be tide-curious,
          studying its mysteries and artifacts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tidebinders often classify themselves based on their emotional ties and
        relation to technology:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tide Acceptors: Those who harmonize with the tide, letting it guide
          their actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tide Navigators: Those who interact with and influence the tide to
          impact their own destiny.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tide Rebels: Those who resist the tide&apos;s pull, whose force of
          will defines their own destiny, but at a cost.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>On a macro scale, the tide varies across the galaxy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          High Tide Zones: Dense with tide energy, they might exhibit floating
          landmasses, bioluminescent flora/fauna, and unpredictable
          technological behaviors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Low Tide Zones: Almost void of tide energy, they often rely on
          traditional tech and could appear barren, with muted colors and little
          to no astral interference.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fluctuating Tide Zones: Unpredictable, transitioning between high and
          low tide states, leading to a mix of the above characteristics and
          often being treacherous to navigate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Astral Borderlands: Transition zones between high and low tide areas,
          hosting a blend of both worlds&apos; features, often acting as trade
          or cultural fusion points.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ancient Forerunner Zones would harken back to the pre-Shift era, where
        tech and tide coexisted seamlessly. These areas might have preserved
        cities, artifacts, and technotide devices. Though rare, they could act
        as bastions of knowledge and power for those who discover them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The astral tide&apos;s pervasive nature shapes not only individuals and
        environments but also politics, economies, beliefs, legends, and more.
      </p>
      <h2>Astral Tide Summary - Part 3: Politics, Economy, and Expansion</h2>
      <p>
        The tide&apos;s omnipresence has inevitable consequences on the
        sociopolitical and economic landscape:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Trade Routes: Traders might favor tide voids or stable zones, but the
          lure of forbidden technotide artifacts might tempt many to risk
          fluctuating or high tide areas, leading to specialized professions
          like tide-navigators or tide-smugglers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Political Power: Regions with control over technotide artifacts or
          Forerunner zones could wield significant influence, as these areas
          hold the keys to unlocking the lost knowledge and power of the
          Forerunners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Religious Sects: Given the mystique of the tide, several religious or
          cultist groups might emerge, worshipping the tide, its anomalies, or
          even the Forerunners themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Military: Armies or mercenaries trained in tide-dense areas, adept at
          using or countering the unpredictable effects of the tide, could be
          highly sought after. Likewise, weaponry harnessing the tide&apos;s
          power could be the pinnacle of warfare technology.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Expansion Ideas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tide-induced Evolution: Over time, species living in strong tide zones
          might evolve unique abilities or features. This can lead to a diverse
          range of species, each adapted to their local tide conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lost Forerunner Expeditions: Exploratory quests to find lost
          Forerunner cities or artifacts, akin to the mythical &quot;El
          Dorado,&quot; could be popular adventures, filled with peril and
          promise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tide Festivals: In regions where the tide is celebrated, annual events
          might mark significant astral occurrences, with tidebinders showcasing
          their skills, and traders exchanging rare artifacts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Research Institutions: Think tanks dedicated to studying the tide,
          aiming to replicate the Forerunner&apos;s harmony between tech and
          tide. These places could be centers of learning but also political
          intrigue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Astral Prophets: Individuals claiming to foresee the future by
          interpreting the tide&apos;s will. Their prophecies could guide or
          mislead whole civilizations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By integrating the tide deeply into every facet of the galaxy&apos;s
        life, from the mundane to the monumental, the Astral tide universe is
        teeming with stories, adventures, and mysteries waiting to unfold.
