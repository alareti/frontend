      <h1>The Dendrans</h1>
      <h2>Conceptual Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Dendrans view the universe through the lens of The Galactic Tree. This
        perspective provides a foundational stability, much like the roots of a
        tree, while also acknowledging the growth and expanse that comes with
        reaching for the sky. They embrace the notion of interconnectedness, and
        the balance between permanence and impermanence, aligning with the
        physical qualities of trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dendrans embody the principle of growth. From their earliest days as
        saplings to their towering presence as mature trees, they symbolize a
        continuous journey toward enlightenment. This journey isn&apos;t linear;
        it&apos;s about grounding oneself (like the roots of a tree) while
        simultaneously reaching for the heavens (like its branches).
      </p>
      <h2>Physical Description</h2>
      <p>
        Dendrans are anthropomorphic tree entities. They are tangible and
        physical, standing in stark contrast to the ethereal Symphonae. Their
        appearance draws inspiration from Ents, those ancient tree-beings of
        fantasy. Sturdy bark comprises their exterior, while limbs stretch out,
        leaves rustling as they move and express themselves.
      </p>
      <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Every Dendran is a distinct entity with a personal sense of growth and
        identity. They live within tribal systems, forming dense forests of
        knowledge and wisdom. While individuals can choose solitude, they
        generally prefer the camaraderie of their own kind. A Dendran&apos;s
        life has various stages: they start as saplings, nurtured by elders, and
        upon completing specific rites of passage, transition into full-fledged
        individuals with the freedom and responsibility of rooting themselves
        wherever they see fit.
      </p>
      <h2>Coming of Age Ritual</h2>
      <p>
        A defining moment in a Dendran&apos;s life, they venture into areas of
        high Tide (which they perceive as the Galactic Sky) to gain insight and
        enlightenment. This journey, full of peril and discovery, culminates in
        their return, where they plant their roots and truly step into
        adulthood.
      </p>
      <h2>Settlements</h2>
      <p>
        Dendrans create settlements that seamlessly blend with their natural
        surroundings. Rather than erecting artificial structures, they cultivate
        the environment, ensuring a harmonious balance between civilization and
        nature. These settlements, while being centers of Dendran society,
        showcase their minimalist yet advanced ethos. They have essentials like
        spaceports, but these too are constructed to have minimal impact on the
        natural world.
      </p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Aligned with their nature-focused philosophy, Dendran tech emphasizes
        physicality. Their spaceships are characterized by strong, durable
        hulls. In terms of weaponry, they prefer ballistic means, with missiles
        and similar arms. Yet, they aren&apos;t ignorant of the threats from
        more ethereal species, ensuring they have the necessary countermeasures
        against such offensives.
      </p>
      <h2>Relation with the Galactic Tree (Tide)</h2>
      <p>
        The Dendrans view the Tide as the Galactic Tree&apos;s life essence. The
        soil, representing areas of low Tide, symbolizes stability and is their
        preferred habitat. However, the Galactic Sky, representing the high Tide
        areas, isn&apos;t feared but rather seen as a source of growth and
        nourishment.
      </p>
      <h2>Galactic Impact & Interaction with Others</h2>
      <p>
        Due to their longevity, Dendrans bring a wealth of knowledge and
        experience to interstellar affairs. They promote stability and wisdom,
        often playing the role of mediators in galactic disputes. This long-term
        perspective might make them appear condescending to younger species, but
        this isn&apos;t out of malice but rather an innate sense of confidence
        in their ways.
      </p>
      <h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        The Dendrans are averse to violence. Their millennia-spanning lifespans
        have bestowed upon them a certain patience. They believe in addressing
        disputes through dialogue and wisdom. When pushed to defend, their
        approach is strategic and measured, always seeking a route that causes
        the least harm and disruption to the natural balance.
      </p>
      <h2>Trade and Diplomacy</h2>
      <p>
        Their deeply-rooted connection to the environment makes them
        unparalleled experts in botanical and ecological matters. In trade, they
        offer resources, medicines, and knowledge that only they possess.
        Diplomatically, they function as advisors and mediators, with many
        species seeking their counsel on interstellar matters.
      </p>
      <h2>Legacy of the Forerunners</h2>
      <p>
        The ancient history of Astralys is something the Dendrans deeply revere.
        They believe that the remnants and teachings of the Forerunners are not
        just artifacts but lessons. They seek to understand and respect this
        legacy, often acting as guardians for sites and relics that are of
        historical significance.
      </p>
      <h2>Interactions with Humans</h2>
      <p>
        The Dendrans might view humans with a mix of fascination and caution.
        Humanity&apos;s rapid pace of growth and change stands in contrast to
        the steady, deliberate evolution of the Dendrans. However, they also
        recognize the potential for collaboration, especially given humans&apos;
        adaptability. Shared ventures in ecological restoration and preservation
        might be common ground for the two species.
      </p>
      <h2>Potential Threats</h2>
      <p>
        Given their physical nature and dependency on stable environments, rapid
        ecological changes or disruptions pose significant threats to the
        Dendrans. Invasive species or diseases, especially those they have no
        prior experience with, could be devastating. Their long lifespans, while
        a strength, could also be a weakness. Rapidly-evolving threats or those
        requiring swift adaptation could catch them off guard.
      </p>
      <h2>Philosophy and Wisdom</h2>
      <p>
        Their relationship with time is profoundly different from most species.
        A century for them might be seen as a mere blink. This perspective
        allows for a depth of thought and philosophy unmatched by many. They
        have a unique understanding of life, death, and rebirth, viewing them
        not as linear stages but as an ever-revolving cycle.
